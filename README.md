# Big Mountain Ski Resort Pricing Model

Big Mountain Resort (BMR), a ski resort located in Montana, offers spectacular views of Glacier National Park and Flathead National Forest. Every year about 350,000 people ski or snowboard at Big Mountain.  The resort offers a vertical drop of 2353 feet, 105 runs serviced by 14 chair lifts including 3 fast quads and 600 acres of snowmaking to ensure snow cover. 
Big Mountain Resort recently implemented a new chair lift to increase distribution of visitors across the mountain. To stay profitable BMR must offset the additional $1.5M/season operating cost for the lift through cost savings or increased revenue. Historically, BMR has charged a premium for its lift tickets compared to the average price of resorts in its market segment without fully understanding which aspect of their facilities provide the most value to customers.  BMR would like to adopt a data driven business strategy allowing them to rationalize higher ticket prices, strategically invest in facilities, and maximize their profitability.  

In addition to rationalizing ticket pricing, this analysis will explore several scenarios to add additional value or remove facilities that are less profitable.   

1.	Permanently closing up to 10 of the least used runs. This does not impact any other resort statistics.
2.	Increase the vertical drop by adding a run to a point 150 feet lower down but requiring the installation of an additional chair lift to bring skiers back up, without additional snow making coverage
3.	Same as number 2, but adding 2 acres of snow making cover
4.	Increase the longest run by 0.2 mile to boast 3.5 miles length, requiring an additional snow making coverage of 4 acres


### Problem Statement
How can Big Mountain Resort restructure their ticket pricing model to offset their new (and ongoing) $1.54M lift operating cost by understanding and maximizing their facility investment strategy before the start of next ski season?
